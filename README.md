**SkyTogether** is a collaborative, AI-powered travel planner designed to help friends and family living in different countries find the perfect destination to reunite. Built for the **Skyscanner Challenge: "The Perfect Reunion"**, this app makes group travel planning fair, fast, and fun.

## üåç Inspiration

After reviewing all the proposed challenges, we were particularly inspired by the idea of reconnecting people who live far apart. This led us to choose the Skyscanner project, *‚ÄúThe Perfect Reunion: Finding the Best Destination for Friends Around the World.‚Äù*

We wanted to create a solution that not only solves a real problem, but also brings people joy by helping them discover exciting destinations that work for everyone.

## üöÄ What It Does

SkyTogether allows a group of users to collaboratively decide where to meet based on:

- ‚úàÔ∏è **Origin cities** of each member  
- üéØ **Travel vibes** (e.g. beach, nightlife, food, culture)  
- ü§ñ **AI-assisted refinement** using Gemini API  
- üí∏ **Individual budget constraints**

### How It Works:
1. One user starts a session and shares a unique code.
2. Each participant:
   - Enters their **origin city**
   - Chooses their **travel vibes**
   - Interacts with an **AI assistant** for personalized suggestions
   - Sets their **budget**
3. The app:
   - Filters cities from a custom dataset
   - Queries the **Skyscanner Flights Live Prices API**
   - Excludes cities above anyone‚Äôs budget
   - Returns the top destinations for **group voting**
